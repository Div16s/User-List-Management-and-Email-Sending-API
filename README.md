# User List Management and Email Sending API

This is a Node.js backend application designed to manage a list of users with customizable properties and send emails to the users. It includes functionalities for list creation, user addition via CSV upload, and sending personalized emails with placeholders.

## Features

1. **List Creation**: Admin can create a list with a title and custom properties.
2. **User Addition**: Admin can add users to the list via CSV upload. The application handles CSVs with 10,000+ records efficiently using `fast-csv`.
3. **CSV Format**: The CSV's first row will have header values. 'name' and 'email' are required fields for a user, and 'email' should be unique. Custom properties can be set for a user by defining headers matching the custom properties title in the CSV.
4. **Unique Emails**: Ensures no two users with the same email are present in a list.
5. **Error Handling**: If some users are not added due to errors, returns the CSV with the list and the error.
6. **Email Sending**: Admin can send an email to the complete list, including custom properties as placeholders in the email body. The email will also contain an unsubscribe link.
7. **Unsubscribe Feature**: Allows users to unsubscribe from the list by clicking a link in the email.
